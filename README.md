**Task 1-Iris Flower Classification ML Project**
This project involves implementing an Iris Flower Classification Machine Learning project using various algorithms. The project uses Python with libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. The dataset is loaded, explored, and preprocessed. Different machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Extra Tree Classifier are employed to classify iris flower species. Each algorithm's performance is evaluated using confusion matrices and classification reports. The results indicate that the Extra Tree Classifier and KNN achieve the highest accuracy of 95%, followed closely by SVM with a linear kernel.
**Task 2-Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using Stacked LSTM**
This project involves Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The project utilizes Python and TensorFlow's Keras library for building the predictive model.The main project steps involve data loading and exploration using pandas, preprocessing of closing prices through scaling, creation of time series sequences for prediction, designing a Stacked LSTM model with sequential and dense layers, training the model with validation, making predictions, evaluating performance using root mean squared error (RMSE), and concluding with visualizations that compare predicted and actual values.
**Task 4-Image to Pencil Sketch with Python**
This project involves Pencil Sketch Image using Python and the OpenCV library. The key steps involve reading and analyzing the provided image, converting it to grayscale, applying thresholding for a black and white effect, inverting the grayscale image, applying Gaussian blur, and finally blending the inverted grayscale image with the blurred image to achieve the pencil sketch effect. The project showcases the transformation of a regular image into a visually appealing pencil sketch using image processing techniques.
**Task 5-Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset-Terrorism**
The project titled "Khadija Amin" involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the "Terrorism" dataset. The project utilizes Python and libraries like pandas and matplotlib to analyze and visualize the dataset.The key steps include data loading, cleaning, and selection of relevant columns. Subsequent analyses and visualizations cover aspects such as most attacked countries, cities, and regions; common attack types and responsible groups; trends in years and months of attacks; victim analysis; attack success trends; and word cloud analysis of attack summaries. The project concludes with a comprehensive terrorism analysis report, summarizing significant findings from the data exploration.
**Task 6-Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm**
The project involves applying the Decision Tree algorithm for prediction. Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn are utilized for data manipulation, modeling, and evaluation. The project begins with loading the Iris dataset and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), including data visualization using pair plots, a heatmap, and a pie chart. Feature scaling is performed, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets. A Decision Tree classifier is then initialized, trained on the training data, and used to make predictions on the test set. The accuracy of the model is calculated, and a confusion matrix along with a classification report is generated to evaluate its performance. Additionally, the Decision Tree model is visualized graphically. The project concludes by highlighting that the Decision Tree algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97% in predicting the Iris dataset's classes.
